ITEM.longdesc = "This artifact is also called 'Heart of the Planet' by some, 'Seed from the Tree of Life' by others, given its ability to seemingly speed up biological growth in a small area around it.\nIt's not a very practical artifact for STALKERs, however it's very sought after by the outside world. How it manages to accelerate the growths of living beings is still a mystery, however, it might explain some of the extreme mutations and evolutions of some of the fauna in the exclusion zone."
