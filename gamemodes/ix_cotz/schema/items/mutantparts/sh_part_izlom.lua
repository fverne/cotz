ITEM.longdesc = "A severed hand of an izlom - an extremely deformed humanoid mutant. It is certain that these creatures used to be humans and that they are the direct result of the second Chernobyl incident. From the remains of their clothing we can deduce that izloms originate from prisoner population that was stationed in the Exclusion Zone and sentenced to forced labor. Since all Izloms suffer almost the same the deformation of the body, it is supposed that when the exposure took place all subjects were in the same body position - either because they were being transported at the time or because someone forced them. All specimens encountered so far were male and sterile. Hence it can be safely assumed that the izlom population is unable to reproduce, and their number in the Zone will be steadily getting lower."
